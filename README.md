# CSCE 240 Final Project Benjamin Goodman

For this project I created a 10x10 garden simulation. In this simulation mushrooms would grow at random locations and snails would move randomly to eat the mushrooms.  Mushrooms have a small chance of being toxic.  If a snail eats a toxic shroom it has a chance of dying.  Toxic shrooms are not able to produce other shrooms.  I ran this simulation to see what the resulting garden would look like over 300 days, ending on the 301st day when winter comes and the garden dies.

Run the simulation by cloning the code and tying the folling in your terminal:

g++ *.cpp
./a.out

or 

g++ -std=c++20 *.cpp
./a.out
